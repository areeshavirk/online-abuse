# online-abuse
This Python code demonstrates the process of tokenizing text data for online abuse detection using the EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b model from the Hugging Face Transformers library. The tokenized data is then used to create a custom PyTorch Dataset and integrated into a PyTorch Lightning DataModule for easy training with DataLoader. This setup can be used to train machine learning models for detecting online abuse, such as hate speech, racism, sexism, and other forms of harmful content.
